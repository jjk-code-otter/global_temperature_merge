Global temperature merge
========================

Code for merging estimates of annual global mean temperature into a single ensemble dataset of global mean temperature. 
Also produces ensembles of radiative forcing and ocean heat content.


Python modules required:
numpy scipy sklearn statsmodels torch openpyxl pandas pathlib matplotlib seaborn requests xarray netCDF4


Download instructions:

1. Download Land_and_Ocean_summary.txt from https://berkeleyearth.org/data/ and put it into the Berkeley Earth folder.

2. Copy-paste China-MST3.0-Imax data http://www.gwpu.net/en/h-nd-166.html from into an excel file. Save the excel file 
   in the China-MST3 folder and name it China-MST3.0-Imax.xlsx.

3. Contact Chris Kadow (kadow@dkrz.de) for access to the climatereconstructionAI ensemble and then save it in the 
   Kadow_ensemble folder. This is similar to the non-ensemble version available from https://zenodo.org/records/11262704

4. Download annual_gm_cobe-stemp3 from https://climate.mri-jma.go.jp/pub/archives/Ishii-et-al_COBE-SST3/gm/ and put it 
   in the COBE-STEMP3 folder.

5. Download DCENT_MLE_v1.1_timeseries_annual_anomalies_ensemble.nc from 
   https://www.wdc-climate.de/ui/entry?acronym=DCENT_MLE_v1_1 and put it in the DCENT_MLE folder.

6. Download C3S_Bulletin_temp_202507_Fig2b_timeseries_anomalies_ref1850-1900_global_allmonths_data.csv from 
   https://sites.ecmwf.int/data/c3sci/bulletin/202507/temperature/ and put it in the ERA5 folder.

7. Download the global mean timeseries GLB.Ts+dSST.csv from https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/ and put it in the 
   GISTEMPv4 folder.

8. Download GloSATref-1-0-0-0_analysis_ensemble-series_global_annual.nc from 
   https://data.ceda.ac.uk/badc/deposited2025/GloSAT/GloSATref-1-0-0-0/analysis/diagnostics/ensemble-series and put it 
   in the GloSAT folder.

9. Download HadCRU_MLE_v1.3_timeseries_annual_anomalies_ensemble.nc from https://doi.org/10.26050/WDCC/HadCRU_MLE_v1.3 
   and put it in the HadCRU_MLE folder.

10. Download HadCRUT.5.0.2.0.analysis.ensemble_series.global.annual.nc and 
    HadCRUT.5.0.2.0.analysis.component_series.global.annual.nc from  
    https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadcrut5/data/HadCRUT.5.0.2.0/download.html and put it in the HadCRUT5 folder.

11. Go to https://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/d640002/dataaccess/#, click "Web File Listing" for anl_surf125, then "Faceted 
    Browse", then select "2m temperature (mean)", and then download all netcdf files since 1981 and save them in the 
    JRA-3Q folder.

12. Go to https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/noaa-global-surface-temperature/v5.1/access/, download annual average 
    NOAAGlobalTempv5.1 land-ocean anomalies time series from 90°S to 90°N as aravg.ann.land_ocean.90S.90N.v5.1.0.asc 
    data, and then put it in the NOAAGlobalTempv5.1 folder.

13. Go to https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/noaa-global-surface-temperature/v5.1/access/timeseries/, download annual 
    average NOAAGlobalTempv6.0 land-ocean anomalies time series from 90°S to 90°N as 
    aravg.ann.land_ocean.90S.90N.v6.0.0.asc data, and then put it in the NOAAGlobalTempv6.0 folder.

14. Go to https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/cmb/ersst/v5/tmp/2019.ngt.par.ensemble/, download and extract all 1000 
    ensemble members that start with temp.ano.merg5.dat, and then put them in the NOAAGlobalTempv5.0 folder. 
    Alternatively, the code automatically downloads and extracts these files for you if you have an internet
    connection.

15. Contact Chris Smith (chris.smith@vub.be) for access to ensemble radiative forcing data files of ERF_DAMIP_1000.nc 
    and ERF_DAMIP_1000_full.nc, and put it in the Radiative Forcing folder. This data is similar to non-ensemble data 
    available from https://zenodo.org/records/15630666.


Running code instructions:

1. Input datasets are converted into a common format using code in the `translators` directory. You can use 
   `run_translators.py` to run the code.

2. Generate pseudo-ensembles using `pseudo_ensembles.py`.

3. Run `make_meta_ensemble.py` to merge datasets based on dataset family trees, which are defined in json files such 
   as `FamilyTrees/hierarchy_ur.json`. Family trees are organised into experiments such as `Experiments/basic.json`.

4. Plots are generated by `make_meta_ensemble.py`. Additional plots can be generated by running 
   `compare_all_ensembles.py` and `plot_ensembles.py`.

5. Run `frechet_distances.py` to perform Fréchet distance tests.

6. Run `radiative_forcing_ensemble.py` to generate radiative forcing ensemble.


Data goes into the `Output` directory and plots go into the `Figures` directory, with subdirectories in each one for 
each "experiment".
