Global temperature merge
========================

Code for merging estimates of annual global mean temperature into a single ensemble dataset of global 
mean temperature.

Input datasets are converted into a common format using code in the `translators` directory. And 
the pseudo-ensembles are generated by `pseudo_ensembles.py`

Merging is performed using `make_meta_ensemble.py` based on dataset family trees defined in json files 
such as `FamilyTrees/hierarchy_ur.json` which are organised into experiments 
such as `Experiments/basic.json`.

Plots are generated by `make_meta_ensemble.py` and additional plots are generated by 
`compare_all_ensembles.py` and `plot_ensembles.py`.

Data goes into the `Output` directory and plots go into the `Figures` directory, with 
subdirectories in each one for each "experiment".
